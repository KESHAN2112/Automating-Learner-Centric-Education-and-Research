# Automating Learner Centric Education and Research

## Project Overview

The project introduces an **integrated virtual scene** that facilitates personalized learning and research by combining cutting-edge AI technologies with interactive virtual environments. It allows users to engage with virtual human agents (e.g., a virtual Einstein teaching relativity) and interactive teacher bots that provide answers in a teacher's voice.

## Objectives

   + To enable personalized, interactive, and immersive learning experiences tailored to individual needs.
   + To develop a platform that integrates AI-driven automation, virtual learning environments with teacher bots, and dynamic content for global accessibility.
   + To leverage automation and advanced technologies to address the limitations of traditional education systems.

## Key Features

1. ### Integrated Virtual Scene:
   + A virtual platform where learners can interact with a teacher bot tailored to specific subjects or topics.
   + Created educational animation content using Blender and embedded it within Unity 3D for seamless virtual learning experience.

2. ### Content Creation:
   + The animation-based content is developed for image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset.
   + The MNIST dataset is trained using multinomial logistic regression, which employs cross-entropy loss to handle multi-class classification problems by predicting a probability distribution over 10 classes for a 10 × 10 image input.

3. ### Teacher Bot:
   + Offers animations (idle, listening, talking) to answer learner's questions sequentially.
   + Provides real-time responses, with an option to connect learners with peers or teachers if needed.

4. ### Technology Stack:
   + **AI and Machine Learning:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification.
   + **Unity 3D:** Platform for virtual environment creation.
   + **Blender:** Used for generating animations and 3D visualizations.
   + **Natural Language Processing:** Large Language Models like GPT and BERT for interactive content.

## Key Sections

1. ### Introduction
   + Discusses the necessity and scope of automating personalized education.
   + Outlines the benefits of automation in making education accessible and efficient.

2. ### Literature Review
   + Reviews emerging AI technologies for content generation, interactive learning, and haptic enhancements.
   + Examines large language models like GPT and BERT for their roles in education.

3. ### Implementation
   + Details the creation and embedding of educational content into a virtual platform.
   + Describes the structure and functioning of the integrated virtual scene.

4. ### Conclusion
   + The project pioneers a unified virtual platform combining AI and automation for personalized, interactive education and research.
   + It demonstrates how advanced technologies like Unity 3D, teacher bots, and haptic enhancements can transform learning experiences.
   + This initiative addresses key limitations of traditional educational limitations, paving the way for a globally accessible and inclusive education.

5. ### Future Directions
   + Enhanced virtual teacher bots with multi-modal communication.
   + Enhancing the platform to support mid-air visualization, cross-device compatibility, and low-cost wearable input devices.
   + Expansion to support additional AI-driven functionalities, such as thought-controlled interfaces.

## How to Use

   + Set up the virtual environment using Unity 3D.
   + Deploy animated educational content created with Blender.
   + Interact with the teacher bot in real-time for a personalized educational experience.

## Acknowledegment

I am deeply grateful to my supervisors — Prof. Vikas Saxena, Director & Head, CSE & IT Department, JIIT, Noida; Prof. Priya Ranjan Trivedi, President, Confederation of Indian Universities; and Dr. Sandeep Marwah, President, Asian Academy of Film and Television, Noida — for their unwavering support and flexibility during my work on the innovative project **Automating Learner Centric Education and Research**, conceived by my parents. Their encouragement, open-mindedness, and guidance allowed me to explore freely and strive toward meaningful contributions.

I extend my gratitude to Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, for providing me with the opportunity to work on this project.
